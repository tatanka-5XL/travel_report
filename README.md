# Welcome to Travelrep

## About

TravelRep is a simple program to generate travel reports. I always hated this stuff so I wanted to create something that would shorten my time spent in the office

### Requirements

Python 3.10+

### Installation

Simply run `main.py`

## Basic principle

The program reads a json file (like `trep.json` in the `Examples`) and generates a txt file with all the basic calculations and info needed

## Future plans

Create a graphic interface for easy data input
Gereate excel sheets ready to be used
