# Welcome to Travelrep

## About

TravelRep is a simple program to generate travel reports. I always hated this stuff so I wanted to create something that would shorten my time spent in the office

### Requirements

Python 3.10+ (www.python.org)

### Installation

Not an installable package yet.

To use the program via command line, navigate current working directory to `*/travelrep/src` and

- to input data:
  run `python3 input.py`(`python input.py` in Windows)

- to generate travel report data:
  find the saved json file (generated by input)
  run `python3 main.py` (`python main.py` in Windows) and input the json file name

## Basic principle

The program reads a json file (like `trep.json` in the `Examples`) and generates an excel sheet with all the basic calculations and info needed

## Future plans

Gereate excel sheets ready to be used
Change to class structure, allow for scalability
Create an installable package, with a graphic interface for easy data input
